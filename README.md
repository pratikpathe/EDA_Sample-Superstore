"# EDA_Sample-Superstore" 

We started by importing libraries such as numpy and pandas.
And import the dataset,
Now I have done some exploratory data analysis,
Here ,I have checked if there are null values in the dataframe or not.
Luckily our dataframe has no null values.
Here I have  printed Full summary of the dataframe and Statistical details of the dataset
Here is the correlation of dataset.

More discount leads to more loss so by providing fewer discounts more profit is made.

More loss is in Binders category, machines category, tables category when compared to others.


Heatmap analysis
•	Sales and Profit are Moderately Correlated
•	Discount and Profit are Negatively Correlated


Overall Analysis
•	The main reason which leads to loss is Discount. Some areas lead to loss due to more discounts and some areas lead to fewer sales due to fewer discounts. It needs to be improved.
•	It is better to give more discounts during festival seasons. So that more sales are made.
•	The Home office segment needs better improvement.
•	Some cities have very less sales. Lack of awareness can be the reason for it. So advertising in those cities will lead to sales.
